# Welcome to alis.exchange 

>**_"Our job as builders is to create the world as it could be."_** - <a href="https://farmerandfarmer.org/mastery/builder.html" target="_blank">Sep Kamvar</a>

Welcome to the community driven platform that makes it remarkably easy to build, maintain and consume API first software.

## Mission
The mission of **alis.exchange** is to empower builders and innovators to solve real problems rather than wasting time reinventing the wheel of cloud infrastructure management and dev ops.

### We believe that API-first cultures win
As systems and organisations grow in complexity, an ever increasing share of effort is expended on non-value adding coordination.
API-first cultures enable teams and systems to decouple dependencies and thereby increase velocity

### We believe that lowering the barriers to building software increases innovation
Many of the "barriers to entry" of software, such as cloud system architecture, identity management, documentation management etc, are non-differentiating. We believe that by removing these barriers we can increase the time and effort dedicated to real innovation and problem solving.

### We believe in the power of community
The **alis.exchange** platform is built and maintained by it's community and for it's community. We believe that together we can build something great!

<!-- This section definitely needs a lot more work -->
## Method
